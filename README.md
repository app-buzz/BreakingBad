# BreakingBad

I use Moya for network abstraction - Which in turn uses Alamofire for networking
I use AlamofireImage to load images asynchronously and applying filters to resize and draw in a circle etc...
I use Signals as a lightweight way to fire events between layers (viewModel to co-ordinators) and binding the view to viewModel

If i had more time i would write unit tests for the Coordinators
