# BreakingBad

* I use Moya for network abstraction - Which in turn uses Alamofire for networking
* I use AlamofireImage to load images asynchronously and for image filters etc...
* I use Signals as a lightweight way to fire events between layers (viewModel to co-ordinators) and binding the view to viewModel
* I am aware that the images are stretched, if i use aspect ratio then walters image is cropped and you cant see his face
* I would like to add a loader to each image

If i had more time i would write unit tests for the Coordinators
