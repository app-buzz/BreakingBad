# BreakingBad

*I use Moya for network abstraction - Which in turn uses Alamofire for networking
*I use AlamofireImage to load images asynchronously and applying filters to resize and draw in a circle etc...
*I use Signals as a lightweight way to fire events between layers (viewModel to co-ordinators) and binding the view to viewModel
*I am aware that the images are stretched, if i use aspect ratio resize then walters image is cropped and you cant see his face
*I would like to a loader to each image

If i had more time i would write unit tests for the Coordinators
